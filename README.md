# Gender_and_Age_Detection_System
This Python project implements a real-time age and gender detection system using OpenCV and pre-trained deep learning models. It effectively identifies faces in images or video streams, estimates the age range and predicted gender for each detected face, and displays the results as bounding boxes and text labels.
